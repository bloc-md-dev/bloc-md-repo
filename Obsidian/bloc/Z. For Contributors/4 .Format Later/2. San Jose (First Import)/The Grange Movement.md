[[San Jose]] [[Grange No. 10]] was founded. It had 20 members, 9 of whom were women. One of the key founders of this organization was [[Andrew Jackson Fowler]] who was an abolitionist. He freed his family’s slaves during the Civil War. It lasted until the 1940s. When [[IBM]] moved in 1944, it signaled a disconnect between land and agriculture, and began the transition from an agricultural center to the tech capitol.

This was the Grange or [[The Order or Patrons of Husbandry]], which was founded in DC in [[1867]]. This was a progressive movement of farmers who were dissatisfied with the two party duopoly.

The goal of the Grange Movement was to establish farmer cooperatives that bypassed the middle-man and organize fair banks. Farmers also demanded a reduction in fare prices for railroads, ports, and freights.

Our city also held the First Annual Convention on October 14, [[1873]].

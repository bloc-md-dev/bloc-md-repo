On January 21, [[1865]], 400 [[San Jose]] workers went on strike at the [[New Almaden Quicksilver Mine]]; It was San Jose's first ever [[strike]].

[[Cinnabar]] played a crucial role in [[Ohlone]] rituals before Spanish [[colonization]]. After [[Mexico]] became independent from [[Spain]], the new Mexican government learned of the Cinnabar mine. Its existence was one of the many reasons for the American capture of [[Mexico]] during the [[Mexican-American War]]. American acquisition of the mine would break the Spanish monopoly on [[Quicksilver]].

After the signing of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo]] and a [[Supreme Court]] battle, the Quicksilver Mine in the [[New Almaden Valley]] landed in the hands of American business interests.

The mine’s first president, [[Samuel Butterworth]], poorly managed the company. Because of his financial woes, it spawned significant worker discontent. From 1865 to [[1868]], the [[Quicksilver Mine]] had four strikes, the first of which occurring on January 21. The labor force was primarily [[Mexican]] and [[Cornish]].

Butterworth paid his workers monthly, and the amount each worker received depended on their job title. While he provided housing for his workers in worker camps, they needed to pay for it with their own wages. The workers received payment based on the amount of material they excavated, rather than the amount of ore extracted.

The [[miners]], or *[[mineros]]*, demanded to be paid every 8 to 15 days (depending on the operator’s prerogative), to have their wages announced so other contractors must comply, free shipment of the goods they ordered from San Jose, and to be paid based on the amount of ore they extracted, not volume.

Two Mexican miners represented the interests of the workers: [[Nicolas Hurtado]] and [[Jose Antonio Garner]]. Nicolas Hurtado attempted to negotiate with Butterworth, and the CEO would describe him as a man who would spread lies and cause trouble, which was more an indictment of Butterworth’s inability to accept the reality of his business practices rather than commentary on Hurtado’s character. Butterworth frequently dismissed Hurtado. Garner was the strike organizer and was also relieved from his duties.

As the mineros went on strike, local media, particularly the [[San Jose Herald]], pushed anti-Mexican views, framing them as lazy, gamblers, and vagrants while celebrating the Cornish workers. This was a ploy to use [[racism]] to divide the working class.

The miners initially believed their strike succeeded and consequently called it off. However, they then realized that management’s capitulation was empty. Butterworth merely stalled and responded to worker unrest by bringing in [[Union]] infantry to intimidate his employees, and it succeeded.

The miners would go on strike again throughout the years. While the labor movement has always existed in San Jose from indigenous cultivation, to native resistance, to [[Spanish missions]], this strike represents a distinct phase in labor’s quest for freedom: the fight against [[wage-slavery]]. This group of workers unknowingly set all the workers of San Jose on a path to liberation, and they taught us an important lesson in the value and power of racial unity. It also exposed the lengths the business-owned media would go to divide working class power. These workers did not demand a return to Mexico; rather, they fought to have dignity and respect within the American borders.

Racial unity built San Jose’s labor movement, and it will be [[racial unity]] that frees San Jose from wage-slavery and guides it into [[socialism]].

[[Andrew Jackson Fowler]] was born in [[Sheridan County]], [[Missouri]] on February 12, 1832. He was an [[abolitionist]] who came to [[San Jose]]. Andrew Jackson Fowler was born into a family of slave-owners. He was the fourth of seven children. His family, like many other slave-owning families, pushed westward at the expense of the [[Native Americans]]. Fowler openly disapproved of slavery and stated that it was one of the “many-sided evils” of society.

In 1852, Fowler and his friends [[John Vance]] and [[Henry Vance]] and [[Richard Tyler]] moved to [[California]], and they would settle in San Jose in the spring of [[1853]]. He purchased 404 acres of land at the price of $1/acre. It was located on [[Mount Hamilton Road]], seven miles east of San Jose. In our city, he accumulated a considerable amount of wealth.

He returned to his family’s property in Missouri. He intended to free the family slaves. When he heard the news of the traitorous attack on [[Fort Sumter]], it gave him all the more reason to give his family’s slaves their deserved freedom. He later joined the local militia in Santa Clara County (his activities are unclear).

Near the end of his life, Fowler invested in the local [[Farmer’s Union]] and [[Grange No. 10]].

Fowler’s life is complicated and hidden from the annals of mainstream history. His legacy is a street sign. However, his story is just one of many that highlight the best of San Jose has to offer. We are a city of people who are committed to helping others, no matter our racial background.

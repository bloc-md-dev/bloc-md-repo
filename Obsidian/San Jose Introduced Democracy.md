In [[1847]], as the conquest of [[California]] rampaged on, Lieutenant-Colonel [[John C. Fremont]] signed the [[Treaty of Campo de Cahuenga]], formally ending the fighting in [[Alta California]], restoring property rights to [[Californios]] and granting it to the incoming American settlers.

The American military established a military governorship to rule over the territory and appointed [[John Sloat]] to administer it. Sloat was the first of seven [[military-governor]]s.

On December 11, [[1848]], a crowd gathered in our city and introduced resolutions to shift the balance of power from a military governorship to a civilian administration. Currently, the military-governor could overturn local orders at his own volition.

The provisional congressional system would remain intact until January 1, [[1849]]. Cities all over the region, from [[San Francisco]] to [[Sacramento]] to [[Sonoma]] to [[Monterey]], held similar meetings and agreed with [[San Jose]]'s initial call. In June 1849, San Francisco even nominated our city as the site to organize a civilian government.

Because of the popularity and organization of the nascent bourgeois class in California, the military-governor Brigadier-General [[Bennet Riley]] organized a [[Constitutional Convention]]. This began the ascendancy of the American [[bourgeoisie]] and their [[democracy]].

Friday January 31, [[2025]] [[Taco Bell]] workers on Stevens Creek Boulevard in [[San Jose]] went on [[strike]].

Taco Bell workers were joined by the [[California Fast Food Workers Union]] and City Council representative [[Peter Ortiz]] and Supervisor [[Betty Duong]] to demand the opportunity to work. An employee at the store, [[Gilberta Acevedo]] commented, "I used 84 hours per paycheck, and now I am down to 14." Not including overtime pay, she received roughly $1,680 per check, and now it is reduced to 280, which is nowhere near enough to survive in San Jose. 

Acevedo described the conditions at the workplace. It has machines that have not been cleaned, serious issues with the drainage, and on occasion, the workers smell gas. Management has also began efforts to reduce working hours. When the employees asked for more, management responded by calling them "animals." Left with no other option, they reached out to the California Fast Food Workers Union for support. 

During the rally, council member Peter Ortiz reminded the rally that San Jose is comprised of a powerful, strong [[Latino]] [[immigrant]] community. He encouraged workers to make a "goddamn union" and fight against the "crooked corporations."

District 2 Supervisor Betty Duong also voiced her support for the striking workers. She reminded them that workers almost never demand higher wages, but rather an honest day's pay after an honest day's work. She proudly declared that "workers' rights are family values."

Avecedo explained how the workers did not want to strike and only did it as a last resort. In her final words, she reminded people that San Jose has a local ordinance that requires San Jose businesses to offer hours to existing employees before hiring new staff. She is referring to "Opportunity to Work Ordinance" which the city overwhelmingly passed in [[2016]].

In the final parts of the rally, Duong proudly declared, "When you fight, you are not just fighting for yourself. You are fighting for all workers in the same situation you are in. When you when, we all win."

January 22, [[1976]], the [[San Jose Police Department]] shot and killed [[Danny Treviño]].

At 1:30AM on the west side of [[San Jose]], Danny Treviño had a drunken argument with his partner [[Maria “Tiny” Duarte]]. Around 2:30AM, Treviño became violent and hit Tiny and her aunt [[Maria Galan]]. As the abuse happened, Tiny’s friend [[Helene Ochoa]] called the San Jose Police. Treviño and Tiny walked to his car even though Treviño was still drunk, and he attempted to drive away but only made it fifty feet. Treviño and Tiny began to talk their problems out.

At 3:00AM, the police arrived and Galan explained to the cops that the fight was over and that the couple was settling their issues. The cop approached the car to verify the situation, his gun unstrapped in its holster. He tapped on the door, and as Treviño attempted to open the door, the cop fired shots into the car. The body would remain in the car for ninety minutes as two more squad cars arrived. The Treviño family was not notified of his death until 10:00AM on January 22.

Treviño’s death spurred a massive movement demanding justice. It built its energy off the slaying of [[John Henry Smith]] in [[1973]]. On February 22, [[1976]], 2,000 protesters demanded justice for Treviño at [[City Hall]].

They had several key demands including but not limited to: the jailing of the cop who killed Treviño, the District Attorney to charge the cop for murder, an independent review of the blood analysis, and the establishment of community oversight of the police.

Historically, dating back to the times of Reconstruction, marginalized people have made the democratic demand for [[community control of the police]]. In San Jose, this manifests itself in the form of the San Jose [[Independent Police Auditor]]. The creation of this position can be seen as a historic demand of oppressed peoples in San Jose to have control over the security and stability of their community.

August 15, [[1905]]. [[Ernesto Galarza]] was an activist, labor organizer, and scholar, being the first Mexican-American to earn a history degree at [[Stanford University]]. Throughout his life, he participated in numerous political movements, such as a tenants union for Southern farmers during the 1930s.

He was an active member in the [[American Federation of Labor]], particularly the [[National Farm Labor Union]]. He led a 30-month strike against the [[DiGiorgio Corporation]] in [[Arvin]], [[California]]. Together with the union, they initiated approximately 20 strikes over the course of 15 years, from [[1948]] to [[1959]].

He firmly believed in [[Pan-Americanism]]: the movement for mutual cooperation among the people in both North and South America, an idea originally formed by Latin American revolutionaries. Though the Pan-American Union was formed in Washington, DC, in 1890, Galarza firmly believed in its mission. Due to his efforts, American business elites were unable to use the institution to further their goals in Latin America. After Galarza's removal in 1948, the [[Pan-American Union]] transformed into the [[Organization of American States]].

Galarza eventually moved to [[San Jose]] toward the end of his life and began to integrate himself into the lives of the people in our city. Most notably, he helped prevent the destruction of [[Alviso]] by San Jose [[city managers]].

Although Galarza experienced both successes and failures in his struggle for justice, he was able to pass on the lessons learned from his efforts when he took one [[Cesar Chavez]] under his wing. Chavez would go on to fight for [[agricultural workers]] throughout the 1970s as a result.

The [[FBI]] would claim Galarza was thoroughly [[communist]], although he was never involved in the Party. We firmly believe in his mission and his goal to create a democracy in which all people benefit, not just a select few. We named our club after him for this very reason.
